*Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)*
This repository contains an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system that uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and recognize vehicle license plates in images and video streams. The system is designed for high accuracy in extracting text from number plates in real-time, and it can be easily adapted for use in various practical applications such as security surveillance, toll collection, and traffic monitoring.

Features
License Plate Detection: Detects vehicle number plates in images or videos using advanced computer vision techniques.
Text Recognition: Extracts the characters on the number plate using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology.
Real-time Processing: Processes live video or camera feeds for number plate recognition.
Customizable: Easy to modify for different license plate formats across regions and countries.
Technologies Used
OpenCV: For image processing and plate detection.
Tesseract OCR: For Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the number plate text.
Deep Learning Models: Optional integration for enhanced detection accuracy.
Python: The primary programming language used for implementation.
Applications
This system can be used in various fields, such as:

Traffic Management: Monitoring traffic flow and detecting vehicles in restricted areas.
Parking Solutions: Automatic number plate-based parking management.
Toll Collection Systems: Automatic toll deduction based on recognized vehicle plates.
Security Surveillance: Tracking vehicles and integrating with security systems.
